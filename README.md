HI!
This project is an assignment from theodinproject on building googles home page with just html and css.

elements were targeted using css selectors which gave me headaches but I'll be good.
had to rely on the dev tools as i had issues targeting(selecting) selectors...ironoc... 
...disobeyed some of the rules... somewhat. i used the svg icons on googles site for mine. and in the course of this, learnt what svg images are(they're awesome) and how to use them.


also my first front end project... nice...
looking foward to more projects!
